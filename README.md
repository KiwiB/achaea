# Nexus Scripts for Achaea
This is a collection of scripts for Achaea for use in the Nexus client.

To download any of the packages, go to the the Releases section above or click [here](https://github.com/samueldcorbin/achaea/releases/latest).

##Important notes
* Several of these scripts rely on advanced JavaScript features that are not supported by older browsers. If something isn't working, make sure you're using the latest version of Chrome or Firefox
* Some of the scripts rely on each other. Make sure to check the REQUIRES section for any script you install. The required packages must appear in the same order in Nexus that they do in the list (you can reorder packages in Nexus by grabbing the dots on the left side of the package name in Reflex Packages and dragging).
* If you follow the package ordering in the table of contents below, there should be no conflicts.
* Some of the scripts require minimal configuration. Make sure to check the SETUP section for any script you install.
